        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm a Systems and Biomedical Engineering student with a strong passion for backend development.
            I specialize in building efficient and scalable APIs using .NET technologies and PostgreSQL.
            I've completed internships and certified training programs in full stack web development, and
            I'm currently working on several real-world projects — including a medical appointment platform
            similar to Vezeeta and a company management system. I'm always eager to solve complex problems,
            learn new technologies, and contribute to impactful software solutions.
